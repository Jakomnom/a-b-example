# a-b-example

### This an example of an a/b testing of a fictional company called kittengram. This is an app where you can register as a user to post pictures of your cat/kitten. Other users can like like and comment of your cats. Only pictures of cats/kittens are allowed on this app. This business model of this app is based on ads. It's not quite successful due to the ads not being relevant and not affecting the user engagement in a good way. A company called Kittenzone recently partnered with Kittengram. They suggested sponsored posts on the feed of the app, so users can see more relevant ads for them related to cat products. The posts will have affiliated links and through these links we'd be able to see whether users are engaging these links.

We need to know the KPIs to measure the success of this new feature and find out whether this new feature will be succesful. Whether the users will like it or the app will be better off without it. The goal is to give the best overview of the performance of the product.

In the first part of the test, we have two datasets available for the users of Kittengram and we'll calculate two metrics that we're interested in. The success metrics for our a/b test will be Daily Active Users (DAU) and Click Through Rate. THe DAU and CTR are important in a sense that in the case of DAU we would like to make sure users keep coming back to the app and as for the CTR we'd like to take a look more closely at the engagement between the new type of sponsored posts vs old type of sponsored posts.
