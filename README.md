# a-b-example

This an example of an a/b testing of a fictional company called kittengram. In the first part of the 
test, we have two datasets available for the users of Kittengram and we'll calculate two metrics
that we're interested in. The success metrics for our a/b test will be Daily Active Users (DAU) and Click Through Rate.
THe DAU and CTR are important in a sense that in the case of DAU we would like to make sure users keep coming back
to the app and as for the CTR we'd like to take a look more closely at the engagement between the new type of sponsored
posts vs old type of sponsored posts.
